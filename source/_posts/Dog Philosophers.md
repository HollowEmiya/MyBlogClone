# 何为犬儒主义

## 安提斯泰尼、第欧根尼、犬儒主义

安提斯泰尼 其实是犬儒主义的开山鼻祖，是苏格拉底的学生。  
第欧根尼在旅行中遇到了安提斯泰尼，想拜他为师，但是安提斯泰尼不喜欢他，因为第欧根尼曾涂改货币导致第欧根尼的父亲入狱。  
但是第欧根尼的倔强打动了他，安提斯泰尼提出了犬儒主义，第欧根尼则是有名的践行者。

### 第欧根尼

在公元前4世纪，一位银行家的儿子通过伪造硬币使锡诺佩市陷入丑闻。当尘埃落定之后，这位名叫第欧根尼的年轻人被剥夺了 国籍，钱和所有财产。  
至少，故事就是这样发展的。尽管戴第欧根尼的许多细节鲜为人知，但因他的耻辱而产生的哲学思想在今天仍然存在。  
在流放中，第欧根尼（Diogenes）相信通过拒绝他人的意见和社会衡量成功的标准，他可以真正获得自由。他将过着自给自足的生活，亲近大自然，不主张物质主义，没有虚荣心或顺从性。  
在实践中，这意味着他在希腊的城市中流浪了很多年，除了斗篷，拐杖和面包袋外什么都没有，一年四季都在外，不使用技术，不洗澡也不吃熟食。他并没有悄悄地追求这种新的存在方式，据说他取笑路人，并在公共场合通过模仿 那些有权势的人吃饭，小便，甚至自慰来嘲笑他们。  
市民称他为 kyôn——一种狂吠的狗。虽然是一种侮辱，但实际上狗是他哲学的一个很好的象征——它们是快乐的动物，不被财富或声誉之类的抽象概念束缚。  
第欧根尼和他越来越多的追随者被称为“狗哲学家”或“ kynikoi”，这一称号最终成为“犬儒主义”一词。这些早期的犬儒主义者无拘无束，被流浪的生活方式所吸引。  
随着戴奥真尼斯声誉的提高，其他人试图挑战他的信仰。亚历山大大帝向他提供了他想要的任何东西。  
但是，第欧根尼（Diogenes）并没有要求任何物资，而是要求亚历山大闪到一边去，不要遮住他的阳光。第欧根尼死后，在接下来的900年，坚持他的哲学的人继续称自己为犬儒主义者，直到500 CE。  
一些希腊哲学家，例如斯多葛派（Stoics），认为每个人都应该效法第欧根尼。他们还试图柔和他的哲学，使其更能被传统社会接受，这当然与他的作法根本背道而驰。  
其他人则不那么乐于接受 犬儒主义者。讽刺作家卢西安（Lucian）在公元2世纪在罗马的叙利亚省中，将自己时代的犬儒主义者描述为无原则，唯物主义，自我推广的伪君子，他们只宣讲了第欧根尼曾经真正实践过的东西。  
几个世纪后，文艺复兴与宗教改革派作家阅读卢西安的著作，称他们的竞争对手为犬儒主义作为侮辱，指那些用毫无价值的话来批评别人的人。这种用法最终为“cynic”一词的现代含义打下了基础：一个人认为其他人都是出于纯粹的个人利益行事，即使他们声称有更高尚的动机。  
然而，犬儒主义的哲学仍然令人钦佩，尤其是那些希望质疑社会状况的人。18世纪的法国哲学家让·雅克·卢梭（Jean-Jacques Rousseau）称艺术，科学和技术使人们腐败，因此被称为“新的第欧根尼”。  
1882年，尼采（Friedrich Nietzsche）重现了一个故事，第欧根尼（Diogenes）带着灯笼进入雅典市场，徒劳地寻找一个诚实的人。在尼采的版本中，一个所谓的疯子冲进了一个城市广场，宣称“上帝已经死了”。  
这是尼采呼吁“价值重估”的方式，他反对基督教和柏拉图关于超越物质世界的普世的，关于精神见解的主导思想。尼采赞扬第欧根尼坚决坚持活在当下。  
最近，人们将1960年代的嬉皮士与第欧根尼（Diogenes）作为反正统文化者进行了比较。第欧根尼的思想被一遍又一遍地重新构想。  
最初的犬儒主义者可能不赞成这些新观点：他们认为反对惯例和亲近自然的价值观是唯一的真价值观。无论您是否同意这一点，或以后的任何化身，它们都具有共同点：他们质疑现状。  
这是我们仍然可以遵循的一个例子：不要盲目地遵循传统或多数人的观点，而要认真思考哪些东西真的有价值。批判性地思考我们的机构和生活方式比以往任何时候都重要。  
用这些视频的观点来阐释你新发现的怀疑主义。

> In the 4th century BCE, a banker's son threw the city of Sinope into scandal by counterfeiting coins. When the dust finally settled, the young man, Diogenes of Sinope, had been stripped of his citizenship, his money, and all his possessions.  
> At least, that's how the story goes. While many of the details of Diogenes' life are shadowy, the philosophical ideas born out of his disgrace survive today.  
> In exile, Diogenes decided that by rejecting the opinions of others and societal measures of success, he could be truly free. He would live self-sufficiently, close to nature, without materialism, vanity, or conformity.  
> In practice, this meant he spent years wandering around Greek cities with nothing but a cloak, staff, and knapsack— outdoors year-round, forgoing technology, baths, and cooked food. He didn't go about this new existence quietly, but is said to have teased passers-by and mocked the powerful, eating, urinating and even masturbating in public.  
> The citizens called him a *kyôn*— a barking dog. Though meant as an insult, dogs were actually a good symbol for his philosophy — they're happy creatures, free from abstractions like wealth or reputation.  
> Diogenes and his growing number of followers became known as "dog philosophers," or *kynikoi*, a designation that eventually became the word "Cynic." These early Cynics were a carefree bunch, drawn to the freedom of a wandering lifestyle.  
> As Diogenes' reputation grew, others tried to challenge his commitment. Alexander the Great offered him anything he desired. But instead of asking for material goods, Diogenes only asked Alexander to get out of his sunshine. After Diogenes' death, adherents to his philosophy continued to call themselves Cynics for about 900 years, until 500 CE.  
> Some Greek philosophers, like the Stoics, thought everyone should follow Diogenes' example. They also attempted to tone down his philosophy to be more acceptable to conventional society — which, of course, was fundamentally at odds with his approach.  
> Others viewed the Cynics less charitably. In the Roman province of Syria in the 2nd century CE, the satirist Lucian described the Cynics of his own time as unprincipled, materialistic, self-promoting hypocrites, who only preached what Diogenes had once actually practiced.  
> Reading Lucian's texts centuries later, Renaissance and Reformation writers called their rivals *cynics* as an insult — meaning people who criticized others without having anything worthwhile to say. This usage eventually laid the groundwork for the modern meaning of the word "cynic": a person who thinks everyone else is acting out of pure self-interest, even if they claim a higher motive.  
> Still, the philosophy of cynicism had admirers, especially among those who wished to question the state of society. The 18th-century French philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau was called the "new Diogenes" when he argued that the arts, sciences, and technology, corrupt people.  
> In 1882, Friedrich Nietzsche reimagined a story in which Diogenes went into the Athenian marketplace with a lantern, searching in vain for a single honest person. In Nietzsche's version, a so-called madman rushes into a town square to proclaim that "God is dead." This was Nietzsche's way of calling for a "revaluation of values," and rejecting the dominant Christian and Platonic idea of universal, spiritual insights beyond the physical world. Nietzsche admired Diogenes for sticking stubbornly to the here-and-now.  
> More recently, the hippies of the 1960s have been compared with Diogenes as counter-cultural rebels. Diogenes' ideas have been adopted and reimagined over and over again.  
> The original cynics might not have approved of these fresh takes: they believed that their values of rejecting custom and living closely with nature were the only true values. Whether or not you agree with that, or with any of the later incarnations, all have one thing in common: they questioned the status quo.  
> And that's an example we can still follow: not to blindly follow conventional or majority views, but to think hard about what is truly valuable. Thinking critically about our institutions and way of life is more important than ever.
